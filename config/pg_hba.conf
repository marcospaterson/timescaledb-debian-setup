# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# Configured for TimescaleDB with security best practices
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     peer

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             all             10.0.0.0/8              scram-sha-256
host    all             all             172.16.0.0/12           scram-sha-256
host    all             all             192.168.0.0/16          scram-sha-256

# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256

# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local   replication     all                                     peer
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECURITY NOTES:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. The above configuration allows connections from private network ranges.
#    For production, restrict these to specific IP addresses or ranges.
#
# 2. SCRAM-SHA-256 is used for password authentication (more secure than MD5).
#
# 3. Consider using certificate authentication for higher security:
#    host    all     all     0.0.0.0/0    cert
#
# 4. For additional security, consider specific database and user restrictions:
#    host    trading_db    trading_user    10.0.10.0/24    scram-sha-256
#
# 5. Monitor connection attempts in PostgreSQL logs.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Replace the broad network ranges above with specific IP addresses:
# host    trading_db      trading_user    10.0.10.30/32          scram-sha-256
# host    trading_db      backup_user     10.0.10.31/32          scram-sha-256
#
# For SSL/TLS connections (recommended for production):
# hostssl trading_db      trading_user    10.0.10.30/32          scram-sha-256
#
# Deny all other connections:
# host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               reject
